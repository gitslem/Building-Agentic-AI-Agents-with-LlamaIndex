## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run these notebooks on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/gitslem/Building-Agentic-AI-Agents-with-LlamaIndex.git](https://github.com/gitslem/Building-Agentic-AI-Agents-with-LlamaIndex.git)
cd Building-Agentic-AI-Agents-with-LlamaIndex
````

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.

```bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Set Up API Keys

This course requires API access to an LLM provider, such as OpenAI.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of this project.

2.  Add your API key to this file:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-sk-api-key-here"
    ```

### 5\. Launch Jupyter Notebook

You are now ready to run the course notebooks.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your browser. Navigate to the `.ipynb` file you wish to run.
